                    <h4>Freddie Mercury</h4>
                    <p>Freddie Mercury was the lead vocalist and pianist of the rock band Queen and is regarded as one 
                        of the greatest singers in the history of rock music</p>
                    <p>The life of Frederick Bulsara began on the East African island of Zanzibar on September 5, 1946.</p>
                    <p>Freddie spent the bulk of his childhood in India where he attended St. Peter’s boarding school.
                         He began taking piano lessons at the age of seven. No one could foresee where a love of music 
                         would take him.</p>
                    <p>The Bulsara family moved to Middlesex in 1964 and from there Freddie joined up
                          with a blues band called Wreckage while studying graphic design courses at Ealing College of Art.
                           While singing for Wreckage, a fellow student introduced Freddie to Roger Taylor and Brian May, 
                           founder members of a band called Smile. Smile metamorphosed into Queen when Freddie joined Roger
                            and Brian as the lead vocalist. The final member of the band, which was to stay together for the
                             next 20 years, was bassist John Deacon, who joined the band on 1st of March 1971.The rest is rock
                              history.</p>
                    <p>EMI Records and Elektra Records signed the band and in 1973 their debut album ‘Queen’ was released and 
                        hailed as one of the most exciting developments ever in rock music.</p>
